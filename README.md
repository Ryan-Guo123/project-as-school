# Project-as-School
**Not “projects inside school,” but “school inside a project.”**  
- One Term · One Project (optionally two). All routine assignments are swapped into the same project evidence (**Assignment Swap**).  
- Grades = **Evidence Snapshot** of this term only (**Snapshot Grading**).  
- Checkpoints at **W3 / W7 / W10** are for diagnosis and support only — not for marks.  
- Projects can **roll forward** across terms and may **legally monetize** with proper consent and compliance.

## Manifesto (v0.1) — Eight Rules
1. **One term = one major project** (at most two). All small assignments fold into project evidence.  
2. **100% of the grade = project evidence**, mapped back to each subject’s outcomes.  
3. **Exams = diagnostics**, not selection; used to locate gaps and target support.  
4. **Time = milestones**, not period blocks: public checkpoints at W3 / W7 / W10; the rest is student-set.  
5. **Assessment = snapshot**: mark only this term’s evidence; don’t punish long-horizon routes.  
6. **Public exhibition + viva**: two hard deliverables — a **90-second demo** and a **two-page reflection**.  
7. **Small teams + load cap**: 2–3 people per team; publish a weekly hours cap to prevent overload.  
8. **Four hard lines**: child safety, privacy, copyright, and experiment safety > everything else.

> **One-liner:** We don’t study for tests; we learn by solving real problems. Tests diagnose; **evidence** decides the grade.

## How this relates to STEAM — and goes beyond
- **STEAM is a subject cluster; Project-as-School is an operating system.** It wraps *all* subjects into one authentic project stream.  
- **From tasks to evidence:** Instead of accumulating task scores, we grade a term **snapshot** (product, data, method, reflection).  
- **From timetable to milestones:** Checkpoints replace seat time; exams become feedback instruments.  
- **Teen-fit scaffolding:** 2–3 person teams, weekly load caps, and 10-minute mentor check-ins keep autonomy safe and sustainable.

## Public examples (non-identifying, for explanation only)
- **Campus energy dashboard:** sampling → simple dashboard → savings brief (snapshot = data sample, charts, 90s demo, reflection)  
- **Walkability heatmap:** survey + field notes → heatmap → improvement proposals  
- **Canteen queue optimization:** timing + flow mapping → split strategy → A/B comparison  
Each example ships the **same three artifacts**: **MVP**, **90-second demo**, **two-page reflection**.

## How to use this repo
This repository publishes the **idea and language** (manifesto + examples).  
Implementation kits (rubrics, consent forms, milestone calendars) should live in a separate private/partner repo during pilots.
